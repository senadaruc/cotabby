#!/usr/bin/env bash
# kickstart.sh - reset this Mac to a first-install state and hand you a fresh Cotabby DMG.
#
# Use it to walk the real new-user path end to end: DMG window -> drag to Applications -> first
# launch -> onboarding -> permission prompts. It covers both app identities (release
# com.jacobfu.tabby and dev com.jacobfu.tabby.dev) because they share TCC, UserDefaults, and
# Application Support conventions, and a stale copy of either can make results misleading.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Stops running Cotabby / Cotabby Dev processes (exact process names, never a broad pkill).
#   2. Resets every TCC permission (Accessibility, Input Monitoring, Screen Recording, ...), before
#      removal and again against the new build.
#   3. Ejects mounted Cotabby volumes, then removes installed/built app bundles for both identities.
#   4. Deletes preferences (via `defaults`, so cfprefsd's cache is cleared too), caches, logs,
#      saved state, and web/HTTP storage. Application Support is cleared except downloaded models,
#      unless --wipe-models is passed.
#   5. Builds a Release DMG the same way .github/workflows/release.yml does (archive, Developer ID
#      signing with hardened runtime, nested re-sign, styled DMG, signed DMG) and opens it.
#
# Why Developer ID signing matters here: TCC remembers a grant by bundle id *and* code signature.
# An ad-hoc signature changes on every build, so permissions would never "stick" and persistence
# testing would be meaningless. Developer ID matches what users run. The one gap versus a real
# release is notarization, which needs CI credentials; a locally built DMG is not quarantined, so
# Gatekeeper still lets it open.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/kickstart.sh [options]
#   --wipe-models   Also delete downloaded models (multi-GB re-download on next onboarding).
#   --clean-only    Reset this Mac but skip building the DMG.
#   --no-open       Build the DMG but do not open it.
#   --adhoc         Ad-hoc sign instead of Developer ID (permissions will not persist across builds).
#   -y, --yes       Skip the confirmation prompt.
#   -h, --help      Show this help.
