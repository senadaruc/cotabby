/// shows, so it should be about one thing; a 40-page PDF as one record would bury the paragraph that
/// answers a question. Why not single paragraphs (as the plain-text Documents source does): text
/// pulled from PDFs and slides breaks at every line, and one-line records carry no context.
///
/// Rule: paragraphs (blank-line separated) are packed together up to `maximumCharacters`; a paragraph
/// longer than that is cut at sentence ends, or hard at the limit when it has none. Whitespace is
/// collapsed, near-empty sections are dropped, and a document yields at most `maximumSections`.
/// Pure.
