/// "Task:" line as if it were the document, so an instruction-blob prompt would leak scaffolding into
/// the ghost text. This renderer treats the model as a pure text continuer: persona, style, language,
/// and supporting context are folded into a short conditioning preface (a base model conditions on
/// description, it does not obey commands), and the exact caret prefix is the LAST thing in the
/// prompt. Spaces, line breaks, and indentation remain part of the text the model continues.
///
/// Sections are character-budgeted via `PromptSectionBudget` so a large glossary, clipboard, or
/// screen capture can never crowd out the caret text: the prefix gets top priority and a guaranteed
/// minimum, and context fills the remaining budget by priority.
