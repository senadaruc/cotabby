/// by its UTF-16 length.
///
/// Why this exists: after the final chunk of a suggestion is accepted, the next generation
/// otherwise waits for the host to publish the insert over Accessibility (10-400ms of polling)
/// before it can even start. Cotabby knows precisely what it just typed, so it can start the
/// next generation against this optimistic snapshot immediately and use the eventual publish as
/// validation: if the host's published content matches this snapshot's content signature, the
/// speculative result is exactly current; if anything differs (autocorrect, IME transformation,
/// a sliding context window), the signature mismatch drops the speculation and the normal
/// poll-driven regeneration takes over. Wrong speculation costs one discarded generation; right
/// speculation removes the publish wait plus a debounce from the visible gap.
