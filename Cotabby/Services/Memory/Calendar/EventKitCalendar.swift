/// The one place Cotabby talks to EventKit: Calendar permission, and events copied out as
/// `CalendarEventSnapshot` values.
///
/// EventKit sees every calendar the Calendar app has (iCloud, Google, Exchange and CalDAV accounts
/// added in System Settings), which is how the corporate calendar reaches Cotabby without reading
/// New Outlook's files. Access is macOS's "Full Access" to Calendars, asked for once from the memory
/// settings (`NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription`); the hardened runtime also needs the app's
/// Calendars entitlement (`Cotabby.entitlements`).
///
/// Threading: an `EKEventStore` is created per read, on whatever background task reads, and never
/// shared, so no store crosses threads. Creating one is cheap next to the sync that uses it.
/// Snapshots are values and cross freely. Used by `CalendarHistoryReader` (memory) and
/// `AnswerCoordinator` (availability).
