/// The window is memory's retention behind and `horizonDays` ahead: upcoming meetings are what
/// answers most often need ("the review is on Thursday at 14:00"). Each event occurrence becomes a
/// record through `CalendarEventText`; a changed event (moved, renamed, cancelled) is the same record
/// again with new text, which the store's upsert replaces.
///
/// Cursor: the time of the last sync. A sync reads the events that changed since then (EventKit's
/// last-modified date, with a small look-back) plus the events that entered the horizon since then,
/// which otherwise would never be read: a meeting 91 days out does not change on the day it comes
/// within 90. The first sync reads everything in the window. An event deleted from the calendar
/// stays in memory until retention removes it (EventKit reports no deletions).
