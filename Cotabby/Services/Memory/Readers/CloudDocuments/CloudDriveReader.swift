/// File overview:
/// Reads the documents of a cloud drive synced to this Mac (iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive)
/// into conversation memory, so answers can draw on them.
///
/// Where the drives are: iCloud Drive in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs`; Google
/// Drive and OneDrive through macOS's File Provider in `~/Library/CloudStorage`, one folder per
/// account (`GoogleDrive-<account>`, `OneDrive-<account>`, and one per shared library). Every
/// account's folder is read, as one source per drive. Nothing is fetched from Google or Microsoft
/// directly; online-only files are downloaded by the drive's own app when read
/// (`DocumentTextExtractor`), then given back.
///
/// Mapping: each file is a conversation titled with its name; its text is split into sections
/// (`DocumentSections`), one record each, sender empty (a shared document's author is not known,
/// and it is never the user's own words). Google Docs, Sheets and Slides (`.gdoc`...) are only links
/// on the Mac; their text stays in Google's cloud and is not read.
///
/// Cursor: the newest modification time read. Files changed since are read whole and replace what
/// memory held for them (`MemoryReadPage.completeConversations`, so a shortened file loses its old
/// tail); pages end between files. `liveConversationIDs` lists every file still there, so the sync
/// removes deleted files from memory.
