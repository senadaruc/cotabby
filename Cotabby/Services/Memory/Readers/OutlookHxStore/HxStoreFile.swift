/// File overview:
/// Reads the mail messages out of New Outlook for Mac's local store, `HxStore.hxd`.
///
/// The store (inferred from this Mac's file; Microsoft publishes no format) is a sequence of records,
/// about 90% of the file, each behind a 20-byte header:
///
/// ```
/// u32 compressed size | u32 uncompressed size | u32 record type (small) | u64 object id | LZ4 block
/// ```
///
/// Nothing in the file says where records start, so the file is scanned: at each offset the header
/// is checked for plausible sizes and the block decoded; a record is accepted only if decoding
/// exactly its compressed bytes yields exactly its declared size, which random bytes practically
/// never do, and the scan then jumps past it. Each record is handed to `HxStoreRecordParser`; the
/// store keeps several versions of a message, so the fullest version per message id is kept.
///
/// The file is memory-mapped and read only; Outlook keeps writing it, so a record cut off by a
/// concurrent write simply fails its check and is picked up by the next sync.
