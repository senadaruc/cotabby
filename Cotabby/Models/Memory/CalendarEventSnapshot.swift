/// it, cannot be built in a test, and is not `Sendable`. Copying the few fields memory and answers
/// use into a value lets the rules that turn events into memory records and availability facts
/// (`CalendarEventText`, `AvailabilityFacts`) be pure and tested, and lets events cross from the
/// background reader to the main actor safely. Built by `EventKitCalendar`; nothing else talks to
/// EventKit.
